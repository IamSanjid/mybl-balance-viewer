# MyBL Balance Viewer
It's a simple thing I glued together after reversing some parts of MyBL Official Android App. It just shows summary of a Banglalink Phone Number's balance.

UI was made using Tailwindcss and Vanilla JS. And the initial design was generated by [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/projects/).

A live page can be found [here](https://mybl-balance-viewer.netlify.app/).

# Build
Just statically serve the `client` folder, `client/index.html` being the main page.
For server:
```sh
cd server
go run .
```

Why do we need a proxy server? Some of the API endpoints used by MyBL App, doesn't support Browser's [preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) requests. And didn't want to be bother with CORS related issues.
